### Problem Statement

**Title:** Create a Function to Return a Key Counting Function for Nested Objects

**Description:**
You are given an object as input, which may contain nested objects as values. Your task is to write a function `createKeyCounter` that takes this object as an argument and returns a new function. The returned function, when invoked, should return the total number of keys present in the input object, including keys in any nested objects.

**Requirements:**
- The function should work for any valid JavaScript object, including those with nested objects.
- The returned function should accurately count the number of keys in the input object, accounting for all levels of nesting.
- No inbuilt methods such as `Object.keys()` or `Object.entries()` should be used to count the keys.

### Hints and Solution Approach

**Hint 1:**  
To handle nested objects, you need to recursively count keys at each level of the object. If a value is another object, call the key counting function on that nested object.

**Hint 2:**  
Use a helper function within `createKeyCounter` to perform the recursive counting. This helper function will be called for each object, including the nested ones.

**Hint 3:**  
Closures will allow the returned function to remember the total count of keys across all levels of the object.

### Solution Approach:
1. Create a function `createKeyCounter` that takes an object as input.
2. Inside this function, define a helper function `countKeys` that takes an object as input and recursively counts the keys, including nested objects.
3. The `countKeys` function should iterate over each key in the object, check if the corresponding value is an object, and recursively count the keys in that nested object.
4. The outer `createKeyCounter` function returns a closure that invokes `countKeys` and returns the total count.

### Complete Solution

```javascript
function createKeyCounter(obj) {
    // Helper function to recursively count keys in the object
    function countKeys(object) {
        let keyCount = 0;

        // Iterate over each key in the object
        for (let key in object) {
            if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) { // Check if the key is a direct property
                keyCount++; // Increment for the current key
                
                // If the value is an object, recursively count its keys
                if (typeof object[key] === 'object' && object[key] !== null) {
                    keyCount += countKeys(object[key]);
                }
            }
        }

        return keyCount;
    }

    // Return a function that returns the total key count
    return function() {
        return countKeys(obj);
    };
}
```

### Test Cases

Here are some test cases to validate the solution:

```javascript
// Test Case 1: Simple object with 3 keys
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const counter1 = createKeyCounter(obj1);
console.log(counter1()); // Expected output: 3

// Test Case 2: Object with nested objects
const obj2 = { a: 1, b: { c: 3, d: 4 }, e: { f: 5 } };
const counter2 = createKeyCounter(obj2);
console.log(counter2()); // Expected output: 5

// Test Case 3: Deeply nested object
const obj3 = { a: { b: { c: { d: 4 } } } };
const counter3 = createKeyCounter(obj3);
console.log(counter3()); // Expected output: 4

// Test Case 4: Empty object
const obj4 = {};
const counter4 = createKeyCounter(obj4);
console.log(counter4()); // Expected output: 0

// Test Case 5: Object with an array as a value (arrays are objects in JavaScript)
const obj5 = { a: [1, 2, 3], b: 2 };
const counter5 = createKeyCounter(obj5);
console.log(counter5()); // Expected output: 2

// Test Case 6: Object with null values (null is not an object)
const obj6 = { a: 1, b: null, c: { d: null, e: 5 } };
const counter6 = createKeyCounter(obj6);
console.log(counter6()); // Expected output: 4
```

### Code Stub

Here is the code stub where you can write the initial solution:

```javascript
function createKeyCounter(obj) {
    // Write your code here
}
```

This implementation ensures that the key count is accurate, even for nested objects, and adheres to the requirement of not using inbuilt methods for key counting.
