### Problem 1: Sequential API Calls with Promises

#### Id : 182749

#### Problem Statement

You are required to make multiple API calls in sequence using Promises. Write a function that calls three APIs one after another, returning the combined response.

#### Problem Description

Given three asynchronous functions `apiCall1`, `apiCall2`, and `apiCall3`, each returns a Promise that resolves to a value. Write a function `fetchDataSequentially` that calls these APIs one after another, passing the result of one API call to the next.

- `apiCall1` returns a string.
- `apiCall2` takes the result from `apiCall1` as a parameter and returns another string.
- `apiCall3` takes the result from `apiCall2` as a parameter and returns the final result.

#### Goals

1. Use Promises to ensure each API call is executed in sequence.
2. Combine the responses from the API calls and return a single string as the output.

#### Solution Approach

1. Call `apiCall1` and wait for the resolved value.
2. Pass that value to `apiCall2`.
3. Take the result of `apiCall2` and pass it to `apiCall3`.
4. Return the combined response.

#### Hints

- Chain `.then()` calls to execute Promises in sequence.
- Use template literals to combine responses.

#### Code Stub

```javascript
function apiCall1() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve("Hello"), 1000));
}

function apiCall2(response) {
  return new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(() => resolve(response + ", World"), 1000)
  );
}

function apiCall3(response) {
  return new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(() => resolve(response + "!"), 1000)
  );
}

// Write your solution here
function fetchDataSequentially() {
  // Implement the logic using Promises
}
```

#### Complete Solution

```javascript
function fetchDataSequentially() {
  return apiCall1()
    .then((result1) => apiCall2(result1))
    .then((result2) => apiCall3(result2))
    .then((finalResult) => finalResult);
}

// Testing
fetchDataSequentially().then(console.log); // Expected output: "Hello, World!"
```

#### Test Cases

1. `fetchDataSequentially()` should return `"Hello, World!"`.
2. Check if all three API calls are called in sequence.
