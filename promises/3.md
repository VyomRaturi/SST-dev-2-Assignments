### Problem 3: Implement Retry Logic for a Failed Promise

#### ID : 182751

#### Problem Statement

Create a function that retries a promise-based operation a specific number of times until it resolves successfully.

#### Problem Description

You are given a function `unstableAPI` that sometimes fails (returns a rejected Promise). Write a function `retryOperation` that retries the `unstableAPI` call up to 3 times before giving up and rejecting the promise with an error message "Operation failed after 3 attempts".

#### Goals

1. Implement retry logic with a maximum of 3 attempts.
2. Resolve the promise if successful, or reject after exhausting retries.

#### Solution Approach

1. Define a recursive function to retry the `unstableAPI` call.
2. Track the number of attempts and stop retrying after 3 failures.

#### Hints

- Use recursion or a loop to implement retry logic.
- Check for rejection and increment the retry count accordingly.

#### Code Stub

```javascript
function unstableAPI() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    Math.random() > 0.7 ? resolve("Success") : reject("Failed");
  });
}

// Write your solution here
function retryOperation(attempts = 3) {
  // Implement retry logic
}
```

#### Complete Solution

```javascript
function retryOperation(attempts = 3) {
  return unstableAPI().catch((error) => {
    if (attempts <= 1) {
      return Promise.reject("Operation failed after 3 attempts");
    }
    return retryOperation(attempts - 1);
  });
}

// Testing
retryOperation()
  .then(console.log) // Expected output: "Success"
  .catch(console.error); // Expected output: "Operation failed after 3 attempts"
```

#### Test Cases

1. Run the function and check if it retries up to 3 times before rejecting.
2. Ensure that the promise resolves if the `unstableAPI` succeeds in fewer than 3 attempts.
