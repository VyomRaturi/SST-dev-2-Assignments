### Problem 2: Handle Multiple Promises
#### Problem Statement
Write a function that handles multiple Promises and returns the data as soon as the first promise resolves.

#### Problem Description
You have three asynchronous functions: `task1`, `task2`, and `task3`. Each returns a Promise that resolves to a string value after a random delay. Write a function `fetchFirstResolvedData` that returns the first resolved value among the three promises.

#### Goals
- Use `Promise.race` to find out which task resolves first.
- Return the resolved value from the fastest Promise.

#### Solution Approach
- Use `Promise.race` to find out which of the three promises resolves first.
- Return that value.

#### Hints
- `Promise.race` can be used to determine the first resolved value from an array of promises.

#### Code Stub
```javascript
function task1() {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve("Task 1 complete"), Math.random() * 2000));
}

function task2() {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve("Task 2 complete"), Math.random() * 2000));
}

function task3() {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve("Task 3 complete"), Math.random() * 2000));
}

// Write your solution here
function fetchFirstResolvedData() {
  // Implement the logic using Promise.race
}
```

#### Complete Solution
```javascript
function fetchFirstResolvedData() {
  return Promise.race([task1(), task2(), task3()]);
}

// Testing
fetchFirstResolvedData().then(console.log); // Expected output: "Task X complete" (where X depends on the fastest response)
```

#### Test Cases
1. The function should return one of the resolved values: `"Task 1 complete"`, `"Task 2 complete"`, or `"Task 3 complete"`.
2. Test for the scenario where all tasks have random delays to ensure `Promise.race` returns the first completed.
