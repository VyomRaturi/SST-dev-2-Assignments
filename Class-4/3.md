### Problem Statement

**Title:** Augment Number Type with an `integer` Method

<!-- Link: https://www.scaler.com/hire/test/problem/173127/ -->

**Description:**

In JavaScript, every number is an instance of the `Number` object, which means that we can augment the `Number` prototype to include custom methods. Your task is to extend the `Number` type by adding a method called `integer` to its prototype. This method should return the integer part of any number it is called on.

The `integer` method should work as follows:

- For positive numbers, it should return the largest integer less than or equal to the number.
- For negative numbers, it should return the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number.

For example:

```javascript
(10 / 3)
  .integer()(
    // should return 3
    -10 / 3
  )
  .integer(); // should return -3
```

**Your Task:**

1. Augment the `Number` prototype to include the `integer` method.
2. Ensure the method works correctly for both positive and negative numbers.

**Hints:**

1. **Number is a function (hence an object)**: You can attach methods to its prototype.
2. **Math.floor() and Math.ceil()**: These methods might be useful in implementing the `integer` method depending on whether the number is positive or negative.

### Example:

```javascript
console.log((10 / 3).integer()); // should output 3
console.log((-10 / 3).integer()); // should output -3
```

### Solution Approach:

1. **Extend the `Number.prototype`:** Attach a method to the `Number` prototype so that it is available on all instances of numbers.
2. **Check if the number is positive or negative:** Use `Math.floor()` for positive numbers and `Math.ceil()` for negative numbers to get the integer part.
3. **Return the result:** Based on the sign of the number, return the appropriate integer value.

### Code Stub:

```javascript
// Extend Number.prototype to include the integer method
Number.prototype.integer = function () {
  // Your code here
};
```

### Complete Solution:

```javascript
// Extend Number.prototype to include the integer method
Number.prototype.integer = function () {
  return this >= 0 ? Math.floor(this) : Math.ceil(this);
};
```

### Test Cases:

```javascript
console.log((10 / 3).integer()); // Expected output: 3
console.log((-10 / 3).integer()); // Expected output: -3
console.log((4.9).integer()); // Expected output: 4
console.log((-4.9).integer()); // Expected output: -4
console.log((0.1).integer()); // Expected output: 0
console.log((-0.1).integer()); // Expected output: 0
```

This problem is designed to deepen your understanding of prototypes in JavaScript and how to extend built-in objects. Implementing this feature will allow you to explore how methods can be added to existing types and how these methods behave across different instances of the type.
